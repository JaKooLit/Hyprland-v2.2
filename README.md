## Hyprland-v2.2
- An slight upgrade from v2.1 which includes installation of Catppuccin Mocha and Latte GTK themes. 
- This can be use to upgrade either Hyprland v2 or v2.1 config files. (Probably will work on HyprLanD configs and/or Ja_Hyprland_dots


## Steps
- clone the repo 
- chmod +x upgrade-v2.2
- ./upgrade-v2.2

-a.) unistall packages gtk-catppuccin-mocha and gtk-catppuccin-latte
