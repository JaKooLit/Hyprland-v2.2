## Hyprland-v2.2
- An slight upgrade from v2.1 which includes installation of Catppuccin Mocha and Latte GTK themes. 
- This can be use to upgrade either Hyprland v2 or v2.1 config files. (Probably will work on HyprLanD configs and/or Ja_Hyprland_dots


## Steps
- clone this repo https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-v2.2.git
- cd Hyprland-v2.2
- chmod +x upgrade-v2.2
- ./upgrade-v2.2



## to revert, 

-a.) uninstall packages gtk-catppuccin-mocha-themes and gtk-catppuccin-latte-themes 

-b.) If ~/.config/hypr-backup is present, simply delete ~/.config/hypr and rename the ~/.config/hypr-backup to ~/.config/hypr
